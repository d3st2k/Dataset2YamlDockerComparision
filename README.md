# Dataset2YamlDockerComparision

- Trying to build a docker image that runs all the other repositories related to Dataset2YamlSchema and compares them to your local machine.
- Cuz my local machine is not the best the benefits of parallel computing cannot be seen as much as on another machine with more cores (even though the program with single-core operability will be faster than mine, it will still be trashed by parallel ones)
